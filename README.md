# pbibtex-base

This bundle contains bibliography styles (.bst) and documents for pBibTeX,
which is a Japanese extended version of BibTeX available from TeX Live.
The documentation files for pBibTeX are included in pbibtex-manual bundle
([CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/pbibtex-manual),
[GitHub](https://github.com/texjporg/pbibtex-manual)).

## Character encoding

All the text files containing Japanese characters are encoded in
ISO-2022-JP. This is because ISO-2022-JP encoded texts are most suitable
for the traditional pTeX and pBibTeX programs.

## Repository
