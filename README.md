# pbibtex-base

These are miscellaneous files, including bibliography styles (.bst),
for pBibTeX, which is a Japanese extended version of BibTeX contained in
TeX Live.

Originally, pBibTeX was known as jBibTeX. When it came to be included
in TeX Live, it was renamed as pBibTeX according to the prefix of pTeX.
Since the bundle contains the original documents of jBibTeX as-is,
their names are jbibtex.pdf, jbtxdoc.pdf, and so on.

## Character encoding

All the text files containing Japanese characters are encoded in
ISO-2022-JP. This is because ISO-2022-JP encoded texts are most suitable
for the traditional pTeX and pBibTeX programs.

## Repository

The bundle is maintained on GitHub:
https://github.com/texjporg/pbibtex-base

If you have issues, please let us know from the above page.

## License

The bundle is redistribution derived from [ptex-texmf distribution
by ASCII MEDIA WORKS](http://ascii.asciimw.jp/pb/ptex/).
Since the original license is the 3-clause BSD license,
this redistribution also follows it (see LICENSE).
